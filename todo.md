- **ai**
  - at its core, is about finding a model—or algorithm—that can most accurately predict outcomes based on a given input, like a dataset.
- **model**
  - Is a Model Just an Algorithm? --> The model is the specific instance of that algorithm, with a defined shape (e.g., layers, parameters, config, setup), but it’s still empty until trained."
  - a trained model is ready to use with new data set to predict
- **data set**
- **overfit**
- **training**
  - teaching a model by feeding it data and adjusting its internal parameters (e.g., weights in a neural network) to recognize patterns.
